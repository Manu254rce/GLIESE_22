This is a cluster of neural network projects aimed at implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and techniques for dealing with data related to Astronomy, Astrophysics
and Earth Science with relation to Physics and Applied Math.


## Basic Setup

1. Clone this repository into your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/Manu254rce/GLIESE_22.git
```

Or by PAT;

```bash
git clone https://<your PAT>@<your repo url>
```

2. Install the required packages inside your conda env (ensure Conda is installed and set in PATH):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate <env name>
```
